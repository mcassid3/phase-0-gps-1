##My Very Exciting Reflections

1) **What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**

I struggled with understanding the git pull and git push functions, specifically with what "origin" meant in those 2 commands. Overall, though, I think I was able to deepen my understanding of the git workflow. Before this session, I was blindly following the steps and not fully understanding the "why" behind the steps of the git workflow

2) **What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**

My guide clarified what origin meant and explained how it does not always have to be GitHub. He showed me an example on his screen illustrating how his repository had 2 origins - Github and Heroku. 

3) **What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**

I asked many questions, some of which included:
    - How do you delete a branch? (I had a typo in the one I made)
    - How come there are files in this new blank repository I just cloned from GitHub (e.g. README.md)? I had forgotten that I had made those settings when making the repo. 
    - What does the git remote -v command do? When do you use it?
    - How often should you really be running git status?

4) **What still confuses you about Git?**

The git fetch vs. git pull commands - I do not fully understand when to use each one. I usually just follow the prompts in the exercise. I also am not quite clear on what the typical development process looks like in terms of when to clone master. Is this the right way to think about it?
    
    1) I clone master from my team's repo on GitHub to my local
    2) I create a new branch and work on my changes. 
    3) I push my feature branch back to GitHub
    4) Next time I work on a feature - I pull down an updated copy of master
    REPEAT
5) **How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**

I *really* liked it. I wish I could do that more frequently. The hour flew by, and I still had many questions remaining by the time we were wrapping up.
